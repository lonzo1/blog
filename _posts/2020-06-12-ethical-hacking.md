Today I started to work on my journey to become proficient at "pentesting". For those of
you who do not know, pentesting, or penetration testing, is the act of evaluating the
security of a website or computer through the exploitation of potential vulnerabilities.
This exploitation is done in a similar way to what a malicious or black hat hacker would do.
These are people who try to exploit a website for personal gain, or sometimes for fun.

I started looking at different places for learning, and I found a website called [Hacker101](https://www.hacker101.com)
which specializes in teaching the basic skills required. One of the first things that
I learned was that Ethical Hackers -- pentesters -- are at a significant disadvantage
due to an inherent power struggle. Malicious hackers only need to find one vulnerability,
while Ethical hackers must find all of them.

I also learned about the skills required to be able to be proficient at the basics. First,
you need to have some knowledge on Python or Ruby (or any other scripting language that
you are comfortable in). This is to do some automation or analysis of a problem. JavaScript
is useful for websites, since websites usually have some JS code for user interaction. Other
languages like Objective-C or Kotlin are more useful for iOS and Android application testing,
but it is not required for website pentesting.

See you soon!
