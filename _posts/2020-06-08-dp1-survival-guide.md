Dear Future IB Student,

Welcome to the IB! These next two years of your life are going to be a very hectic and stressful time,
but there are ways in which you can minimize your suffering. The IB is a very demanding curriculum, but it is very rewarding
in the end, as it demonstrates to universities around the world that you have the appropriate skills to succeed. The IB will
always want from you and it will never back down, so you must change your lifestyle accordingly.

**Get good at time managing.** This is obviously easier said than done, but there are
many ways to learn time management skills if you don't have any. An easy place to start is to have a daily to-do list and
follow it as if it was a holy book. Write down any homework that you have to do and do it on the day it was handed out,
this will give you more time to do more important tasks, like your IAs, later on. Of course, if you are given a week-long
project, delegate that task over the week and don't do it all on the day.

**When you have a question, ask!** In the IB classes move really quickly, so if you find a concept hard to understand
don't be afraid to ask your teacher or your peers for a better explanation. Most of the time you'll find that your teachers
are always happy to help, but you might find that your friends can better explain something, so don't be afraid to ask around.

**Rewrite your notes.** Something that I found very useful for revision is to rewrite my notes. When you rewrite notes, or even
when you write them straight from a book, you'll find that you are memorizing concepts while you write it on the piece of paper.
This is because you are simplifying the concepts to a few phrases, which can lead to a better recall of the concept itself.

**Do practice questions.** After rewriting your notes, you will find it useful to do IB exam-style questions. The IB are notorious
for having straight-forward looking questions which have very specific wants for answers. For example, the question might ask
for you to explain a concept, but then when you look at the answers you find that you are missing a very important piece of
information which you did not think was related to the question. This is why it is a good idea to train your brain to answer
IB exam-style questions. A good place to find exam questions is [IB Documents](https://ibdocuments.com).

**Do CAS reflections before and after the experience.** Doing CAS reflections can make or break your chances at an IB diploma,
so never forget to reflect on your CAS experiences. It is good to do a reflection before the experience, briefly explaining
why you want to do it. Then, right after you do it, reflect on what you did and how it helped you grow as a person. Remember:
the IB wants to see character growth in the reflections.

If you do these things, I can guarantee that you will have a good time doing the IB.

See you soon!
