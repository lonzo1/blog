Hello everyone and welcome to my blog! You should expect to see some content come up soon, but for now I
guess I should give an introduction.

My name is Lorenzo Iannuzzi and I currently live in Western Australia. I am an IBDP student, so some of the
content will be related to CAS (mandatory community service/extracurriculars IBDP students must do) projects
or activities.

You will be able to find the following in this blog:
* Language Learning
* Ethical Hacking
* Programming Related Topics
* Other things of personal interest

See you soon!
