In the coming weeks you should be able to see content being uploaded to the blog.
This will follow a normal schedule, so you should be able to anticipate a new post
during regular intervals.

On Fridays, you should expect to see an upload on Ethical Hacking, and this post could
either be a tutorial, or tips and tricks that I have picked up while learning EH.
Sundays are language days. Here I will be posting my experience in my language learning
endeavors, and I will also be summarizing my learning.

You might see some extra posts every other Monday or so, and on these days I will
discuss my learning habits and what I do to keep myself motivated to do work. I might
also post some rants about programming.

See you soon!
